# HolidayRecipes
Repo to hold holiday recipes. Please feel free to contribute! 

This repo will hold a collection of family holiday recipes that people want to share with others. We're not picky about file format here but text files, word files, or pdfs are probably the best filetypes to use. Please try to avoid spaces in the filenames, underscores are a good substitute for the space character. Enjoy!
