
Ingredients (may vary depending on the size of the casserole dish and the thickness of the layers):

2 packs of oreos for crushing (preferrably mint-flavored)
6 Tbsp Butter
1/2 gallon of Peppermint Ice Cream
2 bags of chocolate chips (for melting)






Instructions:


1. In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter in the microwave. Separately, crush the oreos until they are finely crushed. Pour the melted butter into the crushed oreos and mix until homogeneous. Press the butter-oreo mixture into the bottom of a casserole pan until densely packed. 
2. Separately from Step 1, allow the peppermint ice cream to soften a little bit. After step 1 is complete, spread the softened ice cream in it's own layer on top of the base oreo layer and put back in the freezer to freeze.
3. After freezing the bottom two layers in step 2, completely melt the chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave. Spread the melted chocolate in it's own layer on top of the peppermint ice cream layer. Refreeze the whole thing. You should end up with a three layer dessert with chocolate on top, peppermint ice cream in the middle, and oreo crumble at the bottom. Cut into pieces and enjoy!
