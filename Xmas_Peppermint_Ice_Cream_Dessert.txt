
Ingredients (may vary depending on the size of the casserole dish and the desired thickness of the layers):

1 full pack of oreos for crushing (preferrably mint-flavored)
6 Tbsp Butter
1/2 gallon of Peppermint Ice Cream
1 bag of chocolate chips (for melting)






Instructions:


1. In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter in the microwave. Separately, crush the oreos until they are finely crushed. Pour the 6 Tbsp of melted butter into the crushed oreos and mix until homogeneous. Press the butter-oreo mixture into the bottom of a casserole pan until densely packed. 
2. Separately from Step 1, allow the peppermint ice cream to soften a little bit. After step 1 is complete, spread the softened ice cream in it's own layer on top of the base oreo layer and put back in the freezer to freeze.
3. After freezing the bottom two layers in step 2, completely melt the chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave. Spread the melted chocolate in it's own layer on top of the peppermint ice cream layer. The goal here is to have a thin layer of chocolate at the top, maybe 1/8" thick. After spreading the chocolate to create the top layer, refreeze the whole thing. You should end up with a three layer dessert with a thin layer of chocolate on top, a thicker layer of peppermint ice cream in the middle, and a medium-thickness layer of oreo crumble at the bottom. Cut into pieces and enjoy!








Other notes: 
-If the melted chocolate in step 3 is being uncooperative or otherwise doesn't have a nice smooth texture after microwaving, you can melt 2 Tbsp of butter with the chocolate chips. We've found that this helps create a smoother texture for the melted chocolate, making it easier to pour.

-You can also melt chocolate bars instead of chocolate chips. Break the chocolate bar into pieces before putting it in the microwave. Feel free to experiment with dark chocolate/milk chocolate/anything else.
